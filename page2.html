                <h2>Final: Chelsea vs PSG</h2><br>
                <p>
                    The “Road to the Final” of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has been a showcase of elite football,
                    involving 32 teams across 62 matches. From the group stages to the knockout rounds, only two clubs
                    remain: Chelsea FC and Paris Saint‑Germain. They will meet on July 13th, 2025, in the final held at
                    MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

                    Chelsea earned their place in the final through an unexpected yet remarkable campaign. After
                    qualifying via victory in the UEFA Conference League, they advanced from Group D—finishing behind
                    Flamengo—then beat Benfica (4–1), Palmeiras (2–1), and Fluminense (2–0) in the knockouts. Under
                    manager Enzo Maresca, Chelsea have become a cohesive side known for dynamic midfield play and clutch
                    finishing, standing just 90 minutes away from their second ever Club World Cup title.

                    Paris Saint‑Germain, on the other hand, have maintained dominance throughout the tournament. Winners of
                    Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, and the Champions League (5–0 over Inter Milan), PSG topped Group B and
                    then shut out Bayern Munich (2–0) and Real Madrid (4–0) in the knockout rounds. With manager Luis
                    Enrique at the helm, PSG have exhibited tactical mastery, defensive rigidity, and offensive
                    firepower—backed by standout performances from players like Ousmane Dembélé, who scored 35 goals during
                    the season.

                    The final promises to be a thrilling encounter, with Chelsea looking to upset the odds against a
                    formidable PSG side. Fans worldwide are eagerly anticipating this clash of titans, which will not only
                    crown the champion of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup but also etch another chapter in football history.
